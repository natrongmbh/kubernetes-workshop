# 1. Windows
If installing from the official package repository doesn't work (or requires a specific version), you can download the static binaries and place them in the following paths:

```bash
C:\Kubernetes\
```

In Windows, the **PATH** environment variable can be used to add the `kubectl` command to the system path.

!!! note "Quickstart for Windows"

    Copy the `kubectl` binary directly to the `C:\Windows` directory.

Verify that the `kubectl` command is available.
