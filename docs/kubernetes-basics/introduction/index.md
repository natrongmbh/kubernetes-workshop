#Â Core idea 
With open-source software Kubernetes, you get a platform that can deploy your application in containers and run it simultaneously.  
For this reason, Kubernetes is also known as a container platform, or to use the term container as a service (CaaS).  
Depending on the configuration, the term Platform as a Service (PaaS) also applies. 

# Container engine 
The underlying container engine of Kubernetes is mostly Docker.  
There are other container engines that can be used with Kubernetes, such as CRI-O.
